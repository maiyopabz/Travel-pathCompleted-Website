 `HTML` ,`CSS`, and `Bootstrap5`

Created a responsive start up website. located in the Philippines.

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description 

I started with a simple `navbar` with a bg-dark color and sticky-top attributes. Along with it
I set the `button` toggler with a collapse attribute for mobile first. 

I declared a couple section-tags in the body to hold diffrent content.

* Modal for reservation
* Carousel
* Pricing
* Review section
* Accordion


* Im still currently building more section. I will update more soon.
